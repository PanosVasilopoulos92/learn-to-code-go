In fields of green, where wildflowers bloom,
A melody softly hums.
A gentle breeze, through branches sighs,
As nature's symphony gently flies.

The sunbeams dance, upon the dew,
A shimmering spectacle, ever true.
The birds in chorus, their sweet refrain,
Filling the air with a joyous strain.

The trees stand tall, with branches wide,
Their leaves like emeralds, where sunlight hides.
A tranquil haven, where peace resides,
A sanctuary where beauty hides.

In this verdant realm, where time stands still,
The world outside, we can't recall.
Just let your worries, and cares withdraw,
And let the beauty of nature enthrall.

So close your eyes, and take a deep breath,
Feel the serenity, that nature's worth.
In this moment of peace, let your soul unwind,
And let the wonders of nature, forever entwine.
